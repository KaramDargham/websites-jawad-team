        IMPORTANT ADVERTISER DISCLAIMERS:  Programs do not guarantee that your debts will be lowered by a specific amount or percentage or that you will be debt-free within a specific period of time. Programs do not assume consumer debt, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Programs are not available in all states, and fees may vary by state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss tax consequences of settlement. Please consult with a bankruptcy attorney for more information on bankruptcy. Depending on your state, programs may be available to recommend a local tax professional and/or bankruptcy attorney. You may be subject to collections or lawsuits by creditors or collectors. Your outstanding debt may increase from the accrual of fees and interest. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment, including potential adverse impact on credit rating.

        Certain types of debts are not eligible for enrollment. Some creditors are not eligible for enrollment because they do not negotiate with debt relief companies.

        The company and its affiliates are not lenders, creditors, or debt collectors. This is not a loan. Our representatives have helped thousands of consumers throughout their careers.
