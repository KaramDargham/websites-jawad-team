<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>Welcome to JugglingDebt.com! These Terms of Service are a written contract (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) between you and/or your company (collectively, &ldquo;you&rdquo;) and Consumer Genius Inc. as the owner and operator of JugglingDebt.com (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) and apply to your use of our website (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;).</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>If you don&rsquo;t agree to this Agreement, then you must stop using the Website.</p>
<h1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:21px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">ARBITRATION</span></h1>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><strong>These Terms contain an &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo; where you waive your right to a jury trial and to bring a class action.</strong></p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;;'><span style="color:#C00000;">What is arbitration?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>Legal disputes are usually resolved in a court of law in front of a judge and, sometimes, a jury. Court cases are a matter of public record. Arbitration is a less formal and more private way of resolving disputes. &nbsp;Instead of going to court, the parties give their arguments and evidence to an arbitrator, and the arbitrator decides who &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the case by applying the law in the same way that a judge would. In fact, many arbitrators are retired judges or lawyers. Instead of a courtroom, arbitrations are generally held in a private office, such as a conference room, or by videoconference.</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">What is our Arbitration Agreement?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>Under this Agreement, <strong>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN YOU AND US RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY, OR ANY OF THE OTHER TERMS AND POLICIES LISTED IN THESE TERMS MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION.&nbsp;</strong>This means that we all agree that we will <u>only</u> resolve our legal disputes through arbitration and <u>not</u> in a court of law. &nbsp;W<strong>ithout this Arbitration Agreement, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial.</strong></p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">How will the arbitration work?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>The arbitration must be filed and conducted through JAMS (<a href="http://www.jamsadr.org">www.jamsadr.org</a>), which is a provider of arbitration services in the United States and internationally. JAMS&rsquo; Streamlined Rules will apply to the arbitration. All claims, remedies, and defenses that either you or we have under applicable law (whether federal, state, or local) will remain available to us in the arbitration. Each of us will participate in choosing a neutral arbitrator using the process in the Streamlined Rules. Unless you waive this requirement, the final arbitration hearing (which is like a trial) will take place in person at the JAMS facility closest to your home. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award will consist of a written statement explaining the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision on each claim. The award will also include a concise written statement of the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">What law will the arbitrator follow?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>The laws of California govern this Agreement. The arbitrator will apply California law to the claims in the arbitration.</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">Who pays for the arbitration?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>In most cases, the only fee you will have to pay to JAMS is $250; we will pay all other arbitration costs. However, if the arbitrator decides that you filed your claim in bad faith and without any legal basis, the arbitrator can require you to pay more (or even all) of the JAMS fees for the arbitration.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>The JAMS fees do not include attorneys&rsquo; fees. Regardless of who wins the claim, you will be responsible for paying your attorneys&rsquo; fees and we will be responsible for paying ours. The only exception is if the claim is brought under a law that specifically allows a party to recover its attorneys&rsquo; fees. &nbsp; If this applies, the arbitrator may award attorneys&rsquo; fees as they see fit under such law. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">Are there any instances where a court will get involved?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>Yes. There are things an arbitrator cannot do, like order a party to act or stop doing something&mdash;this is known as &ldquo;equitable relief.&rdquo; Either one of us can go to court and seek equitable relief, including by filing a motion to compel the other party to honor the arbitration agreement. &nbsp; However, you and we agree that the only courts where we will seek equitable relief&mdash;or file any legal proceeding outside of arbitration&mdash;are the state and federal courts in Irvine, California. This exception for equitable relief does <strong><u>not</u></strong> waive our Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:17px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">Can I file a class action?</span></h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>No. You and we agree that we will only file claims against each other individually and not as a plaintiff or class member in a representative proceeding. &nbsp; THIS MEANS CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:21px;font-family:"Calibri Light",sans-serif;color:#2F5496;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;'><span style="color:#C00000;">OUR SERVICES (HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS)</span></h1>
